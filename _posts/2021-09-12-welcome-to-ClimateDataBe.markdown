I want to contribute to helping the Climate cause. But ... in my case of being
already somewhat settled with a house, a car, a job, kids, ... what is the most
efficient thing I can do? Change my eating habits? Buy an electric car (or an
e-bike), isolate my house or ... tear it down and build a new energy neutral
house? Track down climate impact of all stuff I use and buy?

So many questions, and as an engineer, with a strong foundation in thermal
modelling (my PhD was on advanced thermal measurement and control in
semiconductor manufacturing), I want to contribute some effective data to
create most "bang for the buck". What can I do, in my scenario (and other
people's scenarios) that is most effective? Maybe sponsoring some United
Nations or NGO program with 10,000 USD, might be _waaayyy_ more efficient
than replacing the windows of an already older house to save a few liters
of gasoil per year? Don't know yet, that is what I try to calculate here.

I hope to contribute pointers to actual data with good reliability, add
calculations that yield more effective, concrete ways of what we can do
on a personal level, and on a policy level.
