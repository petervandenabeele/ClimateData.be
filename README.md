# ClimateData.be
ClimateData.be presents data and optimization techniques to reduce #climate change
(mitigation) and the impact from it (adaptation).

The site is temporarily available at <a href="https://petervandenabeele.github.io/ClimateData.be/">
https://petervandenabeele.github.io/ClimateData.be/</a> until we arrange the
CNAME file for custom ClimateData.be domain.

## How-to contribute
At this moment, this repository is a "Github Pages" _project page_, with no
theme and no custom DNS.

Changing the content occurs by checking out the `gh-pages` branch and changing the
text there.

Viewing the result locally on your laptop works by going to
`file://.../ClimateData.be/` from a browser.

Pushing the result to the server is by adding, committing and pushing the updated
contents in the `gh-pages` branch (_not_ on this main branch).

If you want to contribute while not a member of this project (yet), you could fork
this code, make a change in the `gh-pages` branch and raise a PR for it.

A simpler technique may be to click the "edit" button (stylus) on
the Github page with the <a href="https://github.com/petervandenabeele/ClimateData.be/blob/gh-pages/index.html">
source code of that page</a> and then make a PR as suggested in that work flow.
