The ClimateData.be project was started by [Peter
Vandenabeele](https://www.vandenabeele.com) as an effort to supply more
good data about Climate Change and see what I (and others) can best do
to help fighting the Climate crisis.

This is work in progres, so far from complete or even usable ...

This work has [source code and licenses](https://github.com/petervandenabeele/ClimateData.be).
