ClimateData.be presents data and optimisation techniques to reduce #climate change (mitigation) and the impact from it (adaptation).

# Most bang for the buck

One way of approaching the problem is "if I want to spend e.g. 1,000 EURO on
fighting Climate Change, where can I best spend it ?".

A possible ranking then becomes: What is the investment cost in EURO per ton CO2 saved ?

In a reverse reasoning, this is equivalent to the carbon tax that would be required to make
this specific behavior economically efficient, even from a purely selfish, short-term perspective,
thus reversing the "tragedy of the commons".

I already did some rough calculations for these scenarios. I still need to publish the
calculations here for review, information and allowing to calculate in other
scenarios:

* eating nearly **NO RED MEAT**. That is the first one I found that has
  a clearly _negative_ cost per saved ton CO2 (equivalent). Obvious ...
  chicken and pork are cheaper than beef and lamb, _and_ produce much less CO2
  (**99 kg CO2/kg meat for beef**, plus massive usage of land, water, ... whereas,
  only 10 kg CO2/kg meat for chicken, and far less land and water usage). In
  absolute numbers, for my scenario (5 portions of meat of 150 gram per week),
  I see a reduction of CO2 per year from 1.162 ton CO2/year to 0.521 ton
  CO2/year, by changing my habits from 2 portions of beef/lamb per week to max.
  1 portion of beef/lamb per month. I have already started that change a few
  months ago and that feels totally OK. One could go further to vegatarian and
  vegan, but the simple change I implemented already slashes that part by 50%.

* heating/isolation of my "old" (1956) house. Here, a DIY isolation under
  the roof may be most efficient, but still, the cost per saved ton CO2 is
  larger than 100 EURO/ton; other scenarios like better isolating windows etc.
  are even more costly (per saved ton CO2), because of a higher cash investment
  and a lower impact on actual CO2, because of the 10 times lower surface.  
  => The DIY roof isolation is a TODO now!

* buying a cheap e-bike to avoid driving a number of kilometers with the car.
  I already did that 5 years ago, but purely economically, the cost per saved
  ton CO2 >> 100 EURO/ton. So that is not an economic driver for CO2 reduction,
  but it surely is fun and better for health :-)

More ideas are still to be calculated for their "bang for the buck" value.
Some ideas:

* investing in environmentally friendly funds (ESG, no fossil fuels, ...)
* sponsor - donate to organisations/actions (in the north or the south ?)
* write to politicians, vote and motivate others to vote
* buy an hybrid or full electric vehicle (instead of diesel/gasoline)
* heating types for houses
* Use train+folding bike instead of car
* different buying patterns (vote with your dollars)
* reduce effect of proof of work in crypto-currencies
* slow fashion: less new clothes
* local travel: discover all the beautiful places close to your door
* teleworking and/or local working: less km and less cars
* ...
